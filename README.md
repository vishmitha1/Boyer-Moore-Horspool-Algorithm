# About the inputFiles.

•	In this code patterns and texts get as external txt files. 

•	When this code runs it ask pattern file and text file as a inputs from the user. 

•	You should be able to give the correct file names as a input.

•	As an example, the pattern which saved in “pattern1.txt” and text file which save in “text1.txt “. 

•	When code ask file names then you should give the right filename that is pattern1.txt and text1.txt  .


# About the outputFiles

•	Also Output file name take from user.

•	You can give any meaning full name to it. 

•	You must enter filename and its’s extension.

•	As an example, if you want to save your output in file name output1 you must enter “output1.txt” as an input.

Calculate Next Shifting Position:
Position = position + Hpbc[text[position + (lengthofpattern -1 ) ]]
